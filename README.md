Want to find me anywhere else? Chances are my name is @ArtyZn there too.

<!-- 

Since it's a repository, all file changes will be saved, right? 
I definitely don't want my chess.com profile to be here, but I guess it's fine for now.
Maybe deleting this repo and creating a new one will help with removing history...
